# 📘 COURSE SPEC — Intermediate Prompt Engineering

## Course Title
**Prompt Engineering: From Zero to Career-Ready**

## Course Level
Intermediate

## Course Promise
> By the end of this course, you will write clear, powerful prompts that get exactly the output you need — for study, coding, projects, resume, interviews, images, videos, and more. No guesswork. Just results.

## Target Audience
- Engineering students (all branches)
- Final-year students preparing for placements
- Students from any degree who want to use AI effectively
- Fresh graduates entering the job market
- Anyone who wants to become 10x productive with AI

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with ChatGPT or any AI chatbot (you've used it at least a few times)
- No coding experience required (coding module is beginner-friendly)
- A laptop or phone with internet access

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, you will be able to:

1. **Write structured prompts** using GCCF, 3R Loop, and CRAFTED frameworks
2. **Control AI output** — format, length, style, and structure
3. **Debug bad prompts** and fix them systematically
4. **Avoid hallucinations** — make AI stick to facts
5. **Create image prompts** for thumbnails, posters, and social media
6. **Write video scripts** with hooks, storyboards, and shot lists
7. **Use AI for coding** — spec, debug, refactor, test, system design
8. **Extract information** — tables, JSON, summaries, flashcards from any text
9. **Solve reasoning problems** — math, logic, interview questions step-by-step
10. **Build placement assets** — ATS resume, LinkedIn profile, interview prep, portfolio stories

## Course Structure
- **10 Modules** (continuous, no tracks)
- **50 Lessons** (5 per module)
- **200+ Ready-to-use Prompts** in a copy-paste library
- **Estimated Time**: 8–12 hours total (10–15 min per lesson)

## How to Use This Course

### For best results:
1. **Go in order.** Modules build on each other. Don't skip.
2. **Try every prompt.** Copy it. Paste it. See what happens. Then tweak it.
3. **Do the challenges.** They take 5 minutes. They make the skill stick.
4. **Use the prompt library.** Bookmark it. Use it daily. Edit prompts for your own needs.
5. **Revisit modules.** Come back to M7 (Coding) before a hackathon. Come back to M10 (Placement) before interviews.

### Time commitment:
- **Casual pace**: 1 lesson/day → finish in ~2 months
- **Focused pace**: 2–3 lessons/day → finish in ~3 weeks
- **Sprint pace**: 5 lessons/day → finish in ~10 days
