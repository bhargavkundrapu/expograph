# Script to Storyboard

**Lesson ID**: M6-L2
**Module**: Video Scripts
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M6-L2 — Convert a script into a visual shot-by-shot plan

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- Turn any video script into a scene-by-scene visual breakdown
- Describe what appears on screen for every line of dialogue
- Create a storyboard you can hand to an editor or follow yourself

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You've written a great script. Now you need to actually film it. Without a storyboard, you'll forget what shots you need. A storyboard tells you exactly what to show on screen for every line — so filming takes 30 minutes instead of 3 hours.

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
make a storyboard
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
A storyboard is a visual representation of your video's scenes.
Here are some tips for creating one:
1. Sketch your scenes on paper
2. Include dialogue and camera angles
3. Plan transitions between scenes
4. Review with your team
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No script provided — the AI has nothing to turn into a storyboard
- No format specified — the AI gave generic tips instead of an actual scene-by-scene plan
- No visual detail requested — the output has zero information about what appears on screen

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Convert this script into a scene-by-scene storyboard.

Script:
"You're still doing assignments the hard way?
Tool 1: ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas.
Tool 2: Gamma for instant presentations.
Tool 3: NotebookLM for smart study notes.
Which one are you trying first? Comment below."

For each scene, provide:
- Scene number
- Dialogue/voiceover text
- What appears on screen (visual description)
- Camera angle (close-up, medium, wide)

Format as a numbered list.
```

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
Scene 1: "You're still doing assignments the hard way?"
Visual: Creator looking at camera, frustrated expression, messy desk
Camera: Close-up on face

Scene 2: "Tool 1: ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas."
Visual: Screen recording — ChatGPT generating a list of ideas
Camera: Screen capture with small facecam in corner

Scene 3: "Tool 2: Gamma for instant presentations."
Visual: Screen recording — Gamma turning notes into a slide deck
Camera: Screen capture, zoom into the finished slide

Scene 4: "Tool 3: NotebookLM for smart study notes."
Visual: Screen recording — NotebookLM summarizing a PDF
Camera: Screen capture with facecam reaction

Scene 5: "Which one are you trying first? Comment below."
Visual: Creator back on camera, pointing down, text overlay: "COMMENT"
Camera: Medium shot, energetic gestures
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Convert this script into a scene-by-scene storyboard with
timing and transitions.

Script:
"You're still doing assignments the hard way?
Tool 1: ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas.
Tool 2: Gamma for instant presentations.
Tool 3: NotebookLM for smart study notes.
Which one are you trying first? Comment below."

For each scene, provide:
- Scene number and timestamp (e.g., 0:00–0:03)
- Dialogue/voiceover text
- What appears on screen
- Camera angle
- Transition to next scene (cut, fade, swipe, zoom)
- On-screen text or graphics (if any)

Format as a numbered list. Total video length: 60 seconds.
```

**What changed**: Added timestamps for each scene, transition types between shots, and on-screen text notes — everything an editor needs to assemble the video without guessing.

---

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Take any short script (use one from Lesson M6-L1 or write a new one)
2. Write a prompt asking the AI to convert it into a storyboard with visuals and camera angles
3. Check the output — does every scene have a clear visual description?

**Your task**: Convert a 45-second script about "my morning routine" into a 4-5 scene storyboard with camera angles and on-screen visuals.

---

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You have this script: "Stop memorizing. Start understanding. Here's the study method that changed my grades. Step 1: Read the topic once. Step 2: Close the book and explain it out loud. Step 3: Check what you missed. Repeat." Turn this into a storyboard with timestamps, visuals, and transitions. Your storyboard should have at least 5 scenes.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I understand how to convert a script into a scene-by-scene storyboard
- [ ] I can write a prompt that asks for visuals, camera angles, and timestamps
- [ ] I tried the guided practice
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- A storyboard breaks your script into individual scenes with visual descriptions
- Providing the actual script text in your prompt gives the AI something concrete to work with
- Adding timestamps and transitions turns a basic storyboard into a complete production plan

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What's the most important thing to include in your prompt when asking for a storyboard?
- A) Your video's title
- B) The actual script text
- C) Your camera brand

**Answer**: B) The actual script text — the AI can't create a shot-by-shot plan if it doesn't have the script to break down.

**Q2**: What does adding timestamps to a storyboard help with?
- A) Making the video go viral
- B) Pacing — knowing how long each scene should last
- C) Choosing background music

**Answer**: B) Pacing — timestamps tell you how long each scene runs so your video fits the target duration exactly.

## SEC-14: ⚡ One-Line Takeaway
> A storyboard is your video's blueprint — give the AI your script and it will show you exactly what to film.
