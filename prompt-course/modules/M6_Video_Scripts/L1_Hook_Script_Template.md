## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M6-L1 — Write attention-grabbing video scripts with Hook-Body-CTA structure

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- Structure any video script using the Hook-Body-CTA framework
- Write opening hooks that stop viewers from scrolling
- End every script with a clear call-to-action (CTA)

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You're recording a project demo for your portfolio. Or maybe a 60-second explainer for Instagram. Without a script, you ramble. With a Hook-Body-CTA script, you grab attention in the first 3 seconds and keep viewers watching until the end.

---

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
write a script for my video
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
Sure! Here's a video script:

Hi everyone, welcome to my channel. Today I want to talk about
something really interesting. So basically, I've been working on
this project and I thought it would be cool to share it with you
all. Let me tell you about it...
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No topic specified — the AI had nothing concrete to write about
- No structure requested — the output is a generic ramble with no hook
- No duration or audience — the AI doesn't know if this is 30 seconds or 10 minutes

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Write a 60-second video script about "3 free AI tools every
college student should use."

Structure:
- Hook (first 3 seconds): Start with a bold question
- Body: Cover 3 tools with one line each
- CTA: Ask viewers to comment their favorite tool

Tone: Energetic, casual, like talking to a friend.
Keep it under 150 words.
```

---

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
HOOK: "You're still doing assignments the hard way?"

BODY:
Tool 1: Use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas in 10 seconds flat.
Tool 2: Use Gamma to turn your notes into stunning presentations.
Tool 3: Use NotebookLM to study smarter with AI-powered summaries.

These three tools saved me hours every single week.

CTA: "Which one are you trying first? Drop it in the comments."
```

---

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Write a 60-second video script about "3 free AI tools every
college student should use."

Structure:
- Hook (first 3 seconds): Start with a pattern interrupt —
  a surprising stat or a bold myth-buster
- Emotional bridge: One line that connects to the viewer's pain
  (wasting time on assignments)
- Body: Cover 3 tools, one line each, with a specific use case
- CTA: Ask a question + tell viewers to follow for more

Tone: Energetic, casual. Use short punchy sentences.
Max 150 words. Add [PAUSE] markers where I should pause for effect.
```

**What changed**: Added an emotional hook, a pattern interrupt opening, pause markers for delivery, and a two-part CTA that drives both comments and follows.

---

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Pick a topic you know well (a tool, a study hack, a recipe)
2. Write a prompt asking the AI for a 60-second script using Hook-Body-CTA
3. Include: topic, hook style, tone, word limit, and CTA type

**Your task**: Generate a script for a 60-second video about your favorite productivity hack. Use the Hook-Body-CTA structure.

---

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You're making a 45-second Instagram Reel about "Why every student needs a portfolio website." Write a prompt that asks the AI for a Hook-Body-CTA script. Your hook must be a surprising statistic. Your CTA must ask viewers to save the post. Run the prompt and tweak the output until it sounds natural when read aloud.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I understand the Hook-Body-CTA structure
- [ ] I can write a prompt that specifies topic, hook style, duration, and CTA
- [ ] I tried the guided practice
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Every great video script has three parts: Hook, Body, and CTA
- Specifying hook style, tone, and word count gives you a script you can actually use
- Adding emotional hooks and pause markers takes your script from good to scroll-stopping

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What are the three parts of the Hook-Body-CTA framework?
- A) Intro, Middle, Outro
- B) Hook, Body, Call-to-Action
- C) Title, Description, Tags

**Answer**: B) Hook, Body, Call-to-Action — the Hook grabs attention, the Body delivers value, and the CTA tells viewers what to do next.

**Q2**: Why should you specify a word count or duration in your script prompt?
- A) To make the AI work faster
- B) So the script matches your actual video length
- C) It doesn't matter

**Answer**: B) So the script matches your actual video length — a 60-second video needs roughly 150 words, and the AI needs that constraint to write the right amount.

## SEC-14: ⚡ One-Line Takeaway
> A great video script isn't written — it's structured: hook them, help them, then tell them what to do next.
