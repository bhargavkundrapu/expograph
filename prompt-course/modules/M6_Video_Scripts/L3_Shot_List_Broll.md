# Shot List & B-Roll

**Lesson ID**: M6-L3
**Module**: Video Scripts
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

---

## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M6-L3 — Plan every shot and supporting B-roll footage for your video

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- Generate a categorized shot list from any script or topic
- Identify where B-roll (supporting footage) is needed
- Tag each B-roll clip with a mood to keep your video visually consistent

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You're about to film a project demo or a campus vlog. You know your script but not what shots to capture. A shot list prevents you from missing key footage. B-roll — those extra clips of hands typing, screens loading, campus walks — makes your video look polished instead of amateur.

---

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
what shots do I need
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
Here are some general shots you might need for your video:
- An opening shot
- Some close-ups
- A few wide shots
- Cutaway shots
- An ending shot
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No script or topic provided — the AI guessed with generic advice
- No categories requested — all shots are lumped together with no structure
- No B-roll mentioned — the output covers only primary shots, not supporting footage

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Create a categorized shot list for a 60-second video about
"3 AI tools every student should use" (ChatGPT, Gamma,
NotebookLM).

Categories:
1. Primary shots (speaker on camera)
2. Screen recordings (app demos)
3. B-roll (supporting footage)

For each shot, include:
- Shot description
- Duration (seconds)
- Type (close-up, medium, wide, screen capture)

List at least 3 shots per category.
```

---

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
PRIMARY SHOTS:
1. Speaker intro — talking to camera, casual setting (0:00–0:03, close-up)
2. Speaker explaining each tool — hand gestures (0:04–0:08, medium)
3. Speaker CTA — pointing at camera (0:50–0:60, close-up)

SCREEN RECORDINGS:
1. ChatGPT — typing a prompt and getting a brainstorm list (5s, screen capture)
2. Gamma — notes turning into a slide deck (5s, screen capture)
3. NotebookLM — uploading a PDF and getting a summary (5s, screen capture)

B-ROLL:
1. Hands typing on laptop keyboard (3s, close-up)
2. Phone screen showing Instagram Reels (2s, close-up)
3. Student studying at desk with notebook (3s, wide)
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Create a categorized shot list for a 60-second video about
"3 AI tools every student should use" (ChatGPT, Gamma,
NotebookLM).

Categories:
1. Primary shots (speaker on camera)
2. Screen recordings (app demos)
3. B-roll (supporting footage)

For each shot, include:
- Shot description
- Duration (seconds)
- Type (close-up, medium, wide, screen capture)

For each B-roll clip, also add:
- Mood tag (e.g., focused, energetic, calm, inspiring)
- When to insert it (after which primary shot)

List at least 3 shots per category.
```

**What changed**: Added mood tags to every B-roll clip and insertion points that tell you exactly when to cut to each B-roll shot — so your edit matches the energy of your script.

---

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Pick a video topic (a tutorial, a day-in-the-life, a product review)
2. Write a prompt asking for a categorized shot list with primary shots, screen recordings, and B-roll
3. Add mood tags and insertion points for your B-roll clips

**Your task**: Generate a shot list for a 45-second video about "my college morning routine." Include at least 3 B-roll clips with mood tags.

---

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You're filming a 60-second LinkedIn video about "How I built my first portfolio website." Write a prompt that generates a full shot list with primary shots, screen recordings, and B-roll. Each B-roll clip must have a mood tag (focused, proud, energetic, or calm) and an insertion point. Run the prompt and check that every moment of the 60 seconds is covered.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I understand the difference between primary shots, screen recordings, and B-roll
- [ ] I can write a prompt that generates a categorized shot list with durations
- [ ] I tried the guided practice
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- A good shot list has three categories: primary shots, screen recordings, and B-roll
- Specifying your script or topic gives the AI enough context to suggest relevant shots
- Mood tags on B-roll clips keep your video's visual tone consistent from start to finish

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What is B-roll?
- A) The main speaker footage
- B) Supporting footage shown while the speaker talks
- C) The background music track

**Answer**: B) Supporting footage shown while the speaker talks — B-roll clips like hands typing or a screen loading make your video visually interesting.

**Q2**: Why should you add mood tags to B-roll clips?
- A) To make the prompt longer
- B) To keep the visual energy consistent with the script's tone
- C) To impress your editor

**Answer**: B) To keep the visual energy consistent with the script's tone — a "calm" clip at a "hype" moment would feel wrong.

## SEC-14: ⚡ One-Line Takeaway
> Plan your shots before you hit record — a shot list with B-roll turns a basic video into a professional one.
