**Lesson ID**: M6-L4
**Module**: Video Scripts
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M6-L4 — Generate captions and text overlays that boost engagement

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- Generate timed captions from any video script
- Add emphasis markers to highlight key words on screen
- Create text overlays like hook text, stats, and labels that keep viewers watching

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

Most people watch videos on mute. If your video has no captions or on-screen text, you lose those viewers instantly. Captions make your content accessible. Text overlays — like a bold stat or a hook phrase — make it scroll-stopping. This works for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or any presentation video.

---

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
add captions
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
To add captions to your video, you can use tools like:
1. YouTube's auto-caption feature
2. CapCut's auto-subtitle tool
3. Descript for transcript-based editing
4. Rev.com for professional captions

Upload your video to any of these platforms to generate captions.
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No script provided — the AI gave tool recommendations instead of actual captions
- No timing or format requested — the output has no timestamps or styling
- "Add captions" is an action, not a prompt — the AI didn't know what text to caption

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Generate timed captions for this 60-second video script.

Script:
"You're still doing assignments the hard way?
Tool 1: ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas in 10 seconds.
Tool 2: Gamma for instant presentations.
Tool 3: NotebookLM for smart study notes.
These three tools saved me hours every week.
Which one are you trying first? Comment below."

For each caption:
- Timestamp (start–end)
- Caption text (max 8 words per line)
- Mark KEY WORDS in caps for emphasis

Format as a numbered list.
```

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
1. [0:00–0:03] You're STILL doing assignments
   the HARD way?

2. [0:04–0:08] Tool 1: CHATGPT
   for brainstorming IDEAS in 10 seconds

3. [0:09–0:13] Tool 2: GAMMA
   for INSTANT presentations

4. [0:14–0:18] Tool 3: NOTEBOOKLM
   for SMART study notes

5. [0:19–0:22] These three tools
   saved me HOURS every week

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Generate timed captions AND text overlay suggestions for this
60-second video script.

Script:
"You're still doing assignments the hard way?
Tool 1: ChatGPT for brainstorming ideas in 10 seconds.
Tool 2: Gamma for instant presentations.
Tool 3: NotebookLM for smart study notes.
These three tools saved me hours every week.
Which one are you trying first? Comment below."

Part 1 — Captions:
- Timestamp (start–end)
- Caption text (max 8 words per line)
- Mark KEY WORDS in caps for emphasis

Part 2 — Text Overlays:
- Hook text for the first 3 seconds (big, bold, attention-grabbing)
- One stat overlay (e.g., a percentage or number)
- Tool name labels that appear when each tool is mentioned
- CTA text overlay for the final scene

Format both parts as numbered lists.
```

**What changed**: Added a second output section for text overlays — hook text, stat callouts, tool labels, and CTA graphics — so you get both captions and visual design notes in one prompt.

---

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Take a short script (from a previous lesson or write a 6-line script)
2. Write a prompt asking for timed captions with emphasis markers
3. Add a request for at least one hook text overlay and one stat overlay

**Your task**: Generate timed captions for a 30-second script about "the best study method." Mark at least 3 key words for emphasis and add one hook text overlay.

---

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You have this script: "Did you know 80% of hiring managers check your LinkedIn? Here's how to fix your profile in 5 minutes. Step 1: Rewrite your headline. Step 2: Add a professional photo. Step 3: List your top 3 skills. Follow me for more career tips." Generate timed captions with emphasis markers AND suggest a hook text overlay, a stat overlay ("80%"), and a CTA overlay. Everything should fit in 45 seconds.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I understand the difference between captions and text overlays
- [ ] I can write a prompt that generates timed captions with emphasis markers
- [ ] I tried the guided practice
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Timed captions need timestamps, short lines, and key word emphasis to work on screen
- Text overlays (hook text, stats, labels) are separate from captions and boost engagement
- Providing your script in the prompt is the key to getting usable captions — not tool suggestions

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: Why should you mark key words in ALL CAPS in your caption output?
- A) Because the AI requires it
- B) So you know which words to bold or animate in your video editor
- C) To make the caption file larger

**Answer**: B) So you know which words to bold or animate in your video editor — emphasized words grab the viewer's eye and reinforce your message.

**Q2**: What's the difference between captions and text overlays?
- A) They are the same thing
- B) Captions follow the dialogue; text overlays are added graphics like stats, labels, and hooks
- C) Text overlays replace captions

**Answer**: B) Captions follow the dialogue; text overlays are added graphics like stats, labels, and hooks — both work together to maximize engagement.
