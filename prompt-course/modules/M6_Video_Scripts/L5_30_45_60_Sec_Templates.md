**Lesson ID**: M6-L5
**Module**: Video Scripts
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M6-L5 — Ready-made templates for 30, 45, and 60-second short-form videos

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- Use three ready-made script templates for 30s, 45s, and 60s videos
- Match your script structure to the right video duration
- Optimize your template for different platforms (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn)

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You want to post a Reel, a YouTube Short, or a LinkedIn video — but you don't know how to fit your idea into 30, 45, or 60 seconds. These templates give you a plug-and-play structure. Pick your duration, fill in the blanks, and you have a script ready to record.

---

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
write a short video
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
Here's a short video script:

Hey everyone! Today I want to share something cool with you.
So I recently discovered this amazing thing and I think you'll
love it too. It's really great and I've been using it a lot.
Anyway, hope you enjoyed this. See you next time!
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No duration specified — "short" could mean 15 seconds or 5 minutes
- No structure or template — the output is filler with no real content
- No topic or platform — the AI wrote a generic script that works nowhere

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Give me 3 video script templates for short-form content:

Template 1 — 30 seconds (~75 words):
- Hook (3 sec)
- One key point (20 sec)
- CTA (7 sec)

Template 2 — 45 seconds (~110 words):
- Hook (3 sec)
- Two key points (30 sec)
- Quick recap (5 sec)
- CTA (7 sec)

Template 3 — 60 seconds (~150 words):
- Hook (3 sec)
- Three key points (40 sec)
- Summary (10 sec)
- CTA (7 sec)

For each template:
- Show the structure with time stamps
- Fill in a sample script using the topic "why you should learn
  prompt engineering"

Format each template clearly with labels.
```

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
TEMPLATE 1 — 30 SECONDS (~75 words)
[0:00–0:03] HOOK: "AI won't take your job. But someone who
knows how to use AI will."
[0:04–0:23] POINT: Prompt engineering lets you get 10x better
results from ChatGPT. One good prompt can replace an hour of
Googling. It's the single most useful skill you can learn this year.
[0:24–0:30] CTA: "Follow for more AI tips."

TEMPLATE 2 — 45 SECONDS (~110 words)
[0:00–0:03] HOOK: "I wasted 2 hours on an assignment. Then I
learned this."
[0:04–0:18] POINT 1: Prompt engineering teaches you to talk to
AI the right way. Better prompts mean better answers.
[0:19–0:33] POINT 2: You can use it for resumes, coding, study
notes, presentations — basically everything in college.
[0:34–0:38] RECAP: One skill. Every use case.
[0:39–0:45] CTA: "Save this and try it today."

TEMPLATE 3 — 60 SECONDS (~150 words)
[0:00–0:03] HOOK: "ChatGPT gives everyone the same AI. Your
prompt is what makes the difference."
[0:04–0:17] POINT 1: Most people type vague prompts and get
vague answers. Prompt engineering fixes that.
[0:18–0:30] POINT 2: You can generate study notes, debug code,
write emails, and build presentations — all with the right prompt.
[0:31–0:43] POINT 3: Companies are already hiring for this skill.
LinkedIn has 10,000+ prompt engineering job listings right now.
[0:44–0:53] SUMMARY: Learn to prompt well and you'll stand out
in college, internships, and your first job.
[0:54–0:60] CTA: "Comment 'PROMPT' and I'll send you my free
template pack."
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Give me 3 video script templates (30s, 45s, 60s) on the topic
"why you should learn prompt engineering."

Use the same structure as before, but now optimize each template
for a specific platform:

- 30s template → Instagram Reels (fast cuts, bold hook,
  visual-first, CTA: "save this")
- 45s template → YouTube Shorts (slightly more depth,
  story-style, CTA: "subscribe")
- 60s template → LinkedIn Video (professional tone, data-backed,
  CTA: "comment your thoughts")

For each template include:
- Timestamps
- Sample script
- Platform-specific tips (2 bullet points)
- Recommended text overlay for the hook

Format each template clearly with labels.
```

**What changed**: Each template is now tuned for a specific platform — different tone, CTA style, and production tips for Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

---

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Pick a topic you want to post about (a skill, a hack, a tool)
2. Choose one duration: 30s, 45s, or 60s
3. Write a prompt asking for a script using the matching template structure

**Your task**: Generate a 45-second script about "3 things I wish I knew in first year of college." Use the 45-second template structure with timestamps and a CTA.

---

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

Create all three templates (30s, 45s, 60s) for the topic "How to use ChatGPT for exam prep." Each template must have timestamps, a sample script, and a platform-specific CTA (Instagram for 30s, YouTube for 45s, LinkedIn for 60s). Run the prompt, read the output aloud, and check that each script fits its time limit.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I understand the structure differences between 30s, 45s, and 60s templates
- [ ] I can write a prompt that generates a duration-specific script with timestamps
- [ ] I tried the guided practice
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Different video durations need different structures — a 30s video has one point, a 60s video has three
- Specifying word count and timestamps keeps the AI's output within your time limit
- Platform-specific optimization changes the tone, CTA, and production style of the same script

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: How many key points should a 30-second video script typically have?
- A) Three
- B) One
- C) Five

**Answer**: B) One — 30 seconds is only ~75 words, so you have time for one strong point and a CTA.

**Q2**: Why should you optimize a script for a specific platform?
- A) Because AI can't write for multiple platforms
- B) Each platform has different audience expectations, tone, and CTA styles
- C) It doesn't make a difference

**Answer**: B) Each platform has different audience expectations, tone, and CTA styles — a LinkedIn video should sound professional while an Instagram Reel should be fast and punchy.
