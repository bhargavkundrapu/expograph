# Module 1: Foundations

> Build the base. Learn how prompts actually work.

## What You'll Learn
This module teaches you how to think about prompts the right way. You'll learn the GCCF framework, remove vagueness from your prompts, and make AI work exactly how you want.

## Why This Matters
Most people write vague prompts and get vague answers. After this module, every prompt you write will be clear, specific, and effective.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | What You'll Master |
