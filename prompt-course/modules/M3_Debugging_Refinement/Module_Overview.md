# Module 3: Debugging & Refinement

> When AI gives bad output, fix it fast.

## What You'll Learn
This module teaches you to diagnose prompt failures, use the 3R Loop to fix them, make AI critique its own work, and build reusable templates.

## Why This Matters
Even great prompts sometimes fail. The difference between a beginner and an expert is knowing HOW to fix a prompt quickly. This module gives you that skill.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | What You'll Master |
|---|--------|--------------------|
| M3-L1 | Common Failure Types | Identify the 5 most common prompt failures |
| M3-L2 | 3R Loop Workflow | Master Request, Review, Refine |
| M3-L3 | Self-Critique Prompts | Make AI evaluate and fix its own output |
| M3-L4 | Prompt Versioning | Track improvements like a pro |
| M3-L5 | Reusable Prompt Templates | Build templates you use again and again |

## Key Framework
**3R Loop** - Request, Review, Refine. The core debugging cycle you'll use forever.

## Time to Complete
50-75 minutes (5 lessons x 10-15 min each)

## Student Relevance
- Fix failed prompts during assignment crunch time
- Build a personal library of working templates
- Debug faster, iterate smarter
