# Composition Control

**Lesson ID**: M5-L2
**Module**: Image Prompting
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Time**: 10–15 minutes

## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M5-L2 — Control layout, camera angle, and framing in image prompts

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- 🎯 Use camera angle and framing terms to control how the image is composed
- 🎯 Apply the rule of thirds and leading lines to create balanced images
- 🎯 Add depth of field to separate your subject from the background

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You generate an image of a person for a project poster, but the AI places them in the corner with awkward cropping. Or you want a dramatic hero shot for a presentation cover, but you get a flat, straight-on photo. Composition control lets you direct the AI like a photographer — you decide where the subject sits, how the camera is angled, and what the viewer sees first.

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
A woman standing in a city at night
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
A full-body shot of a woman standing in the center of a dark city
street. The framing is awkward — too much empty space above her
head. The background is cluttered. No clear focal point. Looks
like a random snapshot, not a composed photograph.
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No **camera angle** — the AI defaulted to a flat, straight-on view
- No **framing** instructions — the subject is poorly positioned with wasted space
- No **composition rules** — no rule of thirds, no leading lines, no visual flow

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Subject: A woman in a leather jacket standing on a rain-soaked city street at night
Composition: Medium shot, camera slightly below eye level (low angle)
Framing: Subject placed on the left third of the frame, rule of thirds
Style: Cinematic photography, neon reflections on wet pavement
Mood: Bold, confident, cyberpunk atmosphere
```

---

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
A cinematic medium shot of a woman in a black leather jacket
standing on a wet city street at night. The camera is angled
slightly upward, making her look powerful and confident. She is
positioned on the left third of the frame. Neon signs in pink and
blue reflect off the rain-soaked pavement, creating colorful
streaks leading toward her. The background shows blurred city
lights. The mood is bold and cyberpunk-inspired.
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Subject: A woman in a leather jacket standing on a rain-soaked city street at night
Composition: Medium shot, low angle camera (slightly below eye level)
Framing: Subject on the left third, rule of thirds, leading lines from the road converging toward her
Depth of field: Shallow — subject is sharp, background is softly blurred (bokeh)
Foreground: Raindrops on a glass surface in the bottom of the frame, slightly out of focus
Style: Cinematic photography, neon reflections on wet pavement
Mood: Bold, confident, cyberpunk atmosphere
```

**What changed**: Added shallow depth of field for a professional look and a blurred foreground element (raindrops on glass) that creates layers — making the image feel three-dimensional instead of flat.

Here are more example prompts with composition terms:

**Example 1 — Close-up portrait:**
```
Subject: A young programmer wearing glasses, looking at camera
Composition: Close-up shot, eye-level camera, centered framing
Depth of field: Very shallow — only the eyes are in sharp focus
Style: Studio portrait, soft ring light
Mood: Friendly, approachable, professional
```
Expected result: A sharp, professional headshot with creamy background blur — great for a LinkedIn profile or team page.

**Example 2 — Wide establishing shot:**
```
Subject: A coworking space with people at laptops
Composition: Wide shot, high angle (bird's eye view tilted at 45 degrees)
Framing: Leading lines from desk rows converging at the center
Style: Bright editorial photography, natural daylight
Mood: Energetic, collaborative, modern
```
Expected result: A dynamic overhead-angle shot of a busy coworking space, ideal for a startup pitch deck.

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Take the prompt you wrote in Lesson M5-L1 and add composition instructions: pick a camera angle (low, high, eye-level) and a framing rule (rule of thirds, centered, symmetrical)
2. Generate the image and compare it to the version without composition terms
3. Try changing the camera angle from low to high — notice how the mood shifts

**Your task**: Write two versions of the same image prompt — one with a low-angle close-up and one with a high-angle wide shot. Compare how they feel.

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You're designing a poster for a college tech fest. The poster needs a dramatic hero image of a student holding a glowing circuit board. Write an image prompt that includes: subject, camera angle (low angle to make the student look heroic), framing (rule of thirds), depth of field (shallow), and mood. Make it look like a movie poster.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I can name at least three camera angles (low, high, eye-level)
- [ ] I can write a prompt that specifies framing and composition
- [ ] I tried the guided practice and compared two compositions
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Camera angle changes mood: low angle = powerful, high angle = vulnerable, eye-level = neutral
- Framing rules like rule of thirds stop the AI from placing subjects awkwardly
- Depth of field separates the subject from the background and adds a professional, cinematic look

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What effect does a low-angle camera have on a subject?
- A) Makes them look small and far away
- B) Makes them look powerful and dominant
- C) Makes the background brighter

**Answer**: B) Makes them look powerful and dominant — low-angle shots look up at the subject, giving them visual authority.

**Q2**: What does "shallow depth of field" mean in an image prompt?
- A) The image is very small in resolution
- B) The subject is sharp and the background is blurred
- C) The image has no background at all

**Answer**: B) The subject is sharp and the background is blurred — this creates a professional photography look and draws the viewer's eye to the subject.

## SEC-14: ⚡ One-Line Takeaway
> You're not just describing an image — you're directing a camera, so tell the AI exactly where to point it.
