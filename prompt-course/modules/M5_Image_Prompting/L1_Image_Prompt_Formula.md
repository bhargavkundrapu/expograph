## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M5-L1 — Master the Subject + Style + Details + Mood formula for image prompts

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- 🎯 Structure any image prompt using four building blocks: Subject, Style, Details, Mood
- 🎯 Turn a vague one-word prompt into a detailed image description
- 🎯 Use negative prompts and aspect ratios to control what the AI generates

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You need a thumbnail for your YouTube video, a banner for your project portfolio, or a social media post graphic. Instead of hiring a designer, you type a prompt into an AI image tool. But "a cat" gives you a random, boring image. This formula gives you control over every part of the image — so you get exactly what you picture in your head.

---

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
a cat
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
A generic stock-photo-style image of a random brown tabby cat
sitting on a white background. No particular style. Flat lighting.
No mood or atmosphere. Could be any cat photo from the internet.
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No **style** specified — the AI picked a generic, default look
- No **details** about the cat's breed, pose, or setting
- No **mood** — the image feels flat and lifeless with no atmosphere

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Subject: A fluffy white Persian cat sitting on a velvet cushion
Style: Digital painting, soft brushstrokes, Studio Ghibli inspired
Details: Golden eyes, a small crown on its head, surrounded by floating cherry blossom petals
Mood: Dreamy, magical, warm evening light
```

---

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
A beautiful digital painting of a white Persian cat perched on a
deep red velvet cushion. The cat has striking golden eyes and wears
a tiny gold crown. Soft pink cherry blossom petals float around it.
The style is reminiscent of Studio Ghibli — gentle brushstrokes,
warm tones, and a dreamy atmosphere. The lighting is soft golden
hour, giving the whole scene a magical, fairy-tale quality.
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Subject: A fluffy white Persian cat sitting on a velvet cushion
Style: Digital painting, soft brushstrokes, Studio Ghibli inspired
Details: Golden eyes, a small crown on its head, surrounded by floating cherry blossom petals
Mood: Dreamy, magical, warm evening light
Negative prompt: no text, no watermark, no blurry edges, no extra limbs
Aspect ratio: 16:9
```

**What changed**: Added a negative prompt to remove common AI artifacts and set a 16:9 aspect ratio for a YouTube thumbnail-ready image.

Here are more example prompts using this formula:

**Example 1 — Portfolio hero image:**
```
Subject: A laptop on a wooden desk with code on the screen
Style: 3D render, minimal, isometric view
Details: Coffee cup beside it, small plant, soft shadows
Mood: Clean, professional, focused
```
Expected result: A clean isometric 3D desk scene perfect for a portfolio website header.

**Example 2 — Instagram post:**
```
Subject: A girl reading a book under a tree
Style: Watercolor illustration, pastel palette
Details: Autumn leaves falling, a small dog sleeping beside her
Mood: Peaceful, nostalgic, golden afternoon
```
Expected result: A soft watercolor scene of a girl reading outdoors in autumn, ideal for a book-themed social post.

**Example 3 — Presentation slide background:**
```
Subject: Abstract mountain landscape
Style: Flat vector art, geometric shapes
Details: Layered mountain ridges, tiny cabin, starry sky
Mood: Calm, inspiring, nighttime
```
Expected result: A geometric vector mountain scene with stars — clean enough for a slide background with text overlaid.

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Pick something you need a visual for — a project thumbnail, a social post, or a presentation slide
2. Fill in all four parts: Subject, Style, Details, Mood
3. Paste your prompt into an AI image tool (DALL-E, Midjourney, or Ideogram) and check the result

**Your task**: Write one image prompt using the Subject + Style + Details + Mood formula. Then add a negative prompt and an aspect ratio. Save both versions.

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You're creating a thumbnail for a coding tutorial video titled "Build a Chat App in 30 Minutes." Write an image prompt using the full formula (Subject + Style + Details + Mood + Negative prompt + Aspect ratio). The thumbnail should look professional, eye-catching, and tech-themed. Write the complete prompt in under 5 minutes.

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I can name the four parts of the image prompt formula
- [ ] I can write a prompt that includes Subject, Style, Details, and Mood
- [ ] I tried the guided practice with a real AI image tool
- [ ] I completed the challenge

---

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Every image prompt needs four parts: Subject, Style, Details, and Mood
- Negative prompts remove unwanted elements like watermarks, blur, and extra limbs
- Aspect ratio controls the shape of your image — use 16:9 for thumbnails, 1:1 for social posts

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What are the four building blocks of the image prompt formula?
- A) Color, Shape, Size, Texture
- B) Subject, Style, Details, Mood
- C) Foreground, Background, Lighting, Filter

**Answer**: B) Subject, Style, Details, Mood — these four parts give the AI enough information to generate a specific, high-quality image.

**Q2**: What does a negative prompt do?
- A) Makes the image darker
- B) Tells the AI what to leave out of the image
- C) Reverses the colors in the image

**Answer**: B) Tells the AI what to leave out of the image — for example, "no watermark, no blurry edges" prevents common AI artifacts.
