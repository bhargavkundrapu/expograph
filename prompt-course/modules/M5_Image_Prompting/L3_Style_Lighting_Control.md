## SEC-00: Lesson ID
> M5-L3 — Set art style, color palette, and lighting in image prompts

---

## SEC-01: 🎯 Goal
What you'll learn in this lesson:
- 🎯 Specify art styles and visual references so the AI doesn't guess
- 🎯 Control lighting type and direction to set the mood of your image
- 🎯 Combine multiple style references into one cohesive image prompt

---

## SEC-02: 💡 Use Case
**When would you use this?**

You want an illustration for your blog, but the AI gives you a photorealistic render when you wanted a hand-drawn sketch. Or you need a warm, golden-hour portrait, but you get harsh midday lighting. Style and lighting are what make an image feel intentional. Master these, and your AI-generated visuals will look like a designer made them.

## SEC-03: ❌ Bad Prompt

Prompt:
```
A forest with a river
```

---

## SEC-04: Bad Output

Output:
```
A generic photorealistic image of a forest with a small river
running through it. Standard green trees, blue water. Flat
midday lighting with no shadows. Looks like a default wallpaper
from 2010. No particular art style or mood.
```

---

## SEC-05: 🔍 Why It Failed
- No **art style** — the AI defaulted to generic photorealism
- No **lighting** direction — flat midday light with no atmosphere
- No **color palette** — random default colors with no visual identity

---

## SEC-06: ✅ Good Prompt

Prompt:
```
Subject: A dense forest with a winding river cutting through it
Style: Oil painting, impressionist, thick visible brushstrokes, like Claude Monet
Lighting: Golden hour — warm sunlight filtering through the trees, long soft shadows
Color palette: Warm greens, deep amber, touches of burnt orange and soft gold
Mood: Serene, nostalgic, early autumn
```

---

## SEC-07: Good Output

Output:
```
A stunning impressionist oil painting of a dense forest. A river
winds through the scene, catching golden reflections. The light
filters through the canopy in warm amber beams, casting long soft
shadows on the forest floor. Thick, visible brushstrokes give
the image a hand-painted feel. The palette is rich — deep greens,
burnt orange leaves, and gold highlights. The overall mood is
peaceful and nostalgic, like a quiet autumn afternoon.
```

## SEC-08: 🚀 Upgrade Prompt
Take it one level higher:

Prompt:
```
Subject: A dense forest with a winding river cutting through it
Style: Combine the thick brushstrokes of impressionist oil painting with the fantastical nature of Studio Ghibli backgrounds — lush, slightly exaggerated foliage
Lighting: Golden hour — warm sunlight filtering through the trees at a low angle, volumetric light rays (god rays) visible in the mist
Color palette: Warm greens, deep amber, touches of burnt orange, soft gold, with cool blue-purple shadows for contrast
Mood: Serene, magical, early autumn
```

**What changed**: Combined two style references (impressionism + Studio Ghibli) into one prompt and added volumetric light rays for a more dramatic, layered look.

Here are more example prompts with style and lighting control:

**Example 1 — Flat vector style for a presentation:**
```
Subject: A person sitting at a desk with a laptop
Style: Flat vector illustration, clean lines, minimal shading, Dribbble-style
Lighting: Even, flat lighting — no shadows
Color palette: Soft pastels — light blue, lavender, peach, white
Mood: Clean, modern, friendly
```
Expected result: A clean flat-design illustration of someone working — perfect for a slide deck or landing page.

**Example 2 — Dramatic portrait with rim lighting:**
```
Subject: A young man in a hoodie looking straight at the camera
Style: Cinematic photography, high contrast
Lighting: Rim light from behind (backlit), with a single blue light on the left side of the face
Color palette: Dark tones, deep blue, cool shadows, bright edge highlights
Mood: Mysterious, intense, dramatic
```
Expected result: A moody, high-contrast portrait with a glowing rim light — great for a music cover or personal brand image.

**Example 3 — Retro pixel art:**
```
Subject: A small coffee shop on a rainy street corner
Style: 16-bit pixel art, retro game aesthetic
Lighting: Warm interior glow spilling out of the shop windows onto the wet sidewalk
Color palette: Muted blues and grays outside, warm yellows and oranges inside
Mood: Cozy, lo-fi, nostalgic
```
Expected result: A charming retro pixel-art scene with warm shop lights against a rainy backdrop — perfect for a lo-fi playlist thumbnail.

## SEC-09: 📝 Guided Practice
Try this yourself:

1. Pick one subject (a landscape, a person, or an object)
2. Write two versions of the same prompt — one in "watercolor illustration" style with soft natural light, and one in "cyberpunk digital art" style with neon lighting
3. Generate both and compare how style and lighting change the entire feel

**Your task**: Write two prompts for the exact same subject but with completely different styles and lighting. Note three specific differences between the outputs.

## SEC-10: 🏆 Challenge
**5-Minute Challenge**:

You're making a cover image for a personal blog about late-night coding sessions. Write an image prompt that captures the "coding at 2 AM" vibe. Include: subject, a specific art style, a lighting setup (think screen glow + desk lamp), a color palette, and mood. The image should make someone feel the quiet focus of a late-night session.

---

## SEC-11: ✅ Checklist
Before moving on, confirm:
- [ ] I can specify at least three different art styles in a prompt
- [ ] I can write a prompt that controls lighting type and direction
- [ ] I tried the guided practice with two different styles
- [ ] I completed the challenge

## SEC-12: 🧠 What You Learned
- Art style tells the AI whether to paint, photograph, illustrate, or render — never leave it to chance
- Lighting is the single biggest mood-setter: golden hour feels warm, rim light feels dramatic, flat light feels clean
- You can combine multiple style references in one prompt to create a unique look

---

## SEC-13: 📋 Mini Quiz
**Q1**: What happens when you don't specify a style in your image prompt?
- A) The AI always generates a watercolor
- B) The AI picks a generic default style, usually photorealistic
- C) The AI asks you to choose a style

**Answer**: B) The AI picks a generic default style, usually photorealistic — which is rarely what you actually want.

**Q2**: Which lighting setup would create a warm, peaceful mood?
- A) Harsh flash from the front
- B) Golden hour sunlight at a low angle
- C) Cold fluorescent overhead light

**Answer**: B) Golden hour sunlight at a low angle — warm, directional light with long shadows creates a calm, inviting atmosphere.

## SEC-14: ⚡ One-Line Takeaway
> Style is the personality of your image and lighting is its emotion — define both, or the AI will pick boring defaults.
