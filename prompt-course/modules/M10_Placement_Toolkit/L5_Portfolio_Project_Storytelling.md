## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- 🎯 Write a prompt that converts raw project details into a recruiter-friendly description
- 🎯 Use the Problem-Solution-Impact format to tell a compelling project story
- 🎯 Add quantified metrics and tech stack highlights to make your project stand out

## 💡 Use Case

Every student has projects. Few know how to describe them. Recruiters spend about 6 seconds scanning a resume or portfolio. A description that says "Built a to-do app using React" tells them nothing impressive. Use this technique when writing project sections on your resume, portfolio site, LinkedIn, or GitHub README.

## ❌ Bad Prompt

```
Describe my project.
```

---

<!-- SEC-04 -->
## 📤 Bad Output

```
This is a web application built using modern technologies. It allows
users to perform various tasks efficiently. The project demonstrates
full-stack development skills and was completed as part of a
college assignment.
```

## 🔍 Why It Failed

- **No project details** — the AI has nothing specific, so it writes filler.
- **No format** — you got a vague paragraph instead of a structured description.
- **No audience context** — the AI does not know this is for a recruiter, so it writes like a school report.

## ✅ Good Prompt

```
Goal: Write a project description that impresses recruiters.
Context: I built an e-commerce dashboard during my internship. It
shows real-time sales data. I used React for the frontend, Node.js
and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The
dashboard has filters by date range, product category, and region.
It loads data for 10,000+ orders in under 2 seconds. The client
used it to replace their Excel-based reporting.
Constraints: Keep it under 100 words. Write for a recruiter who
has 10 seconds to read it.
Format: Use the Problem-Solution-Impact structure:
  - Problem (1 sentence): what issue existed
  - Solution (2–3 sentences): what you built and how
  - Impact (1 sentence): what measurable result it achieved
```

## 📤 Good Output

```
Problem: The client's sales team relied on manual Excel reports that
took hours to compile and were often outdated by the time they were
shared.

Solution: Built a real-time e-commerce dashboard using React,
Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The dashboard features dynamic
filters for date range, product category, and region, pulling live
data from a database of 10,000+ orders with sub-2-second load times.

Impact: Replaced the manual Excel workflow entirely, saving the
sales team approximately 5 hours per week on reporting.

## 🚀 Upgrade Prompt

```
Goal: Write a project description for my portfolio AND enhance it
with metrics and tech stack highlights.
Context: I built an e-commerce dashboard during my internship. It
shows real-time sales data. I used React for the frontend, Node.js
and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The
dashboard has filters by date range, product category, and region.
It loads data for 10,000+ orders in under 2 seconds. The client
used it to replace their Excel-based reporting.
Constraints: Main description under 100 words. Recruiter audience.
Format: Return three sections:
  1. Project description in Problem-Solution-Impact format
  2. Metrics box — a bullet list of 3–4 quantified achievements
     (use numbers: users, speed, time saved, etc.)
  3. Tech stack tags — a single line listing each technology as a
     tag (e.g., React · Node.js · MongoDB)
```

**What changed:** We added a metrics box and tech stack tag line. Recruiters love numbers and scannable tech tags. The metrics box quantifies your impact and the tag line makes your stack visible at a glance.

## 🛠️ Guided Practice

1. Pick one project you have built (college project, internship, or personal).
2. Write down the raw details: what it does, what tech you used, any numbers you remember (users, speed, records, time saved).
3. Build a prompt using the Good Prompt structure. Ask for Problem-Solution-Impact format.

**Your task:** Generate a recruiter-ready description for your own project. Check that it has a clear problem, a specific solution, and at least one measurable impact number.

## ⚡ Challenge (5 minutes)

**Scenario:** Your classmate built a weather app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeatherMap API. It shows current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city. About 50 classmates use it. They describe it as: "A weather app I made for fun."

Write a prompt that turns this into a Problem-Solution-Impact description with a metrics box and tech stack tags. Run it and check if a recruiter would find it impressive.

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] I understand the Problem-Solution-Impact format for project descriptions.
- [ ] I can write a prompt that produces a recruiter-friendly project story with metrics.
- [ ] I tried the guided practice with my own project.
- [ ] I completed the challenge and reviewed the metrics box output.

## 📚 What You Learned

1. Problem-Solution-Impact turns "I built X with Y" into a story that shows your value.
2. Numbers make your project memorable — quantify speed, users, time saved, or records handled.
3. A tech stack tag line makes your skills instantly scannable for recruiters.

## ❓ Mini Quiz

**Q1:** Your project description says "Built a web app using React." Why would a recruiter skip over it?

- A) React is not popular enough
- B) It has no problem, no impact, and no numbers — it says nothing about value
- C) It is too short

> **A1:** B — without a problem and impact, the description does not show why the project matters or what you achieved.

**Q2:** What is the purpose of the metrics box in the Upgrade Prompt?

> **A2:** It pulls out your most impressive numbers (users, speed, time saved) into a scannable list so recruiters can see your impact at a glance.

## 💬 One-Line Takeaway

> A project without a story is just code — use Problem-Solution-Impact to show recruiters what you built, why it mattered, and what it achieved.
