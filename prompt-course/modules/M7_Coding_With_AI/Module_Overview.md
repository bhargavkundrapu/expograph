# Module 7: Coding With AI

> Write better code faster. Debug smarter. Ship projects faster.

## What You'll Learn
This module teaches you to use AI for coding specifications, debugging, refactoring, test case generation, and system design planning.

## Why This Matters
AI won't replace programmers. But programmers who use AI will replace those who don't. This module makes you the programmer who ships 10x faster.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | What You'll Master |
|---|--------|--------------------|
| M7-L1 | Spec Prompts | Turn a vague idea into a clear coding spec |
| M7-L2 | Debug Prompts | Find and fix bugs using AI systematically |
| M7-L3 | Refactor Prompts | Clean up messy code with structured prompts |
| M7-L4 | Test Case Generation | Auto-generate test cases for any function |
| M7-L5 | System Design Prompts | Plan architecture and system design with AI |

## Key Skill
Spec-first coding. Write the spec with AI, then build the code. This approach eliminates confusion and rework.

## Time to Complete
50-75 minutes (5 lessons x 10-15 min each)

## Student Relevance
- Build projects faster for hackathons
- Debug college assignments in minutes
- Prepare system design answers for interviews
