# Module 2: Output Control

> Tell AI exactly how to respond. Tables, JSON, bullets, strict format.

## What You'll Learn
This module gives you full control over AI output. You'll learn to get tables, JSON, specific lengths, strict-mode responses, and multiple versions of the same content.

## Why This Matters
Getting a good answer is step one. Getting it in the exact format you need is the real skill. This module makes you a format master.

## Lessons

| # | Lesson | What You'll Master |
|---|--------|--------------------|
| M2-L1 | Format Control - Tables | Get clean, structured tables from any data |
| M2-L2 | Format Control - JSON | Get machine-readable JSON for projects |
| M2-L3 | Length Control | Control output: 1 line, 1 paragraph, or 1 page |
| M2-L4 | Strict Mode - No Extra Text | Make AI output ONLY what you asked |
| M2-L5 | Multi-Version Output | Get 3 different versions in one prompt |

## Key Skill
Formatting is what separates a casual AI user from a power user. After this module, you control the output — not the AI.

## Time to Complete
50-75 minutes (5 lessons x 10-15 min each)

## Student Relevance
- Format research data into tables for reports
