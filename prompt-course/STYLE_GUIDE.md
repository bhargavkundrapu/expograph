# ✍️ STYLE GUIDE — Prompt Engineering Course

## Writing Rules

### Sentence Structure
- Use **short sentences**. Max 15–20 words per sentence.
- One idea per sentence. One idea per paragraph.
- Use active voice: "Write a prompt" not "A prompt should be written."
- Start sentences with verbs when giving instructions: "Open ChatGPT. Type this prompt. Read the output."

### Tone
- Friendly. Like a senior student helping a junior.
- Motivating. Never condescending.
- Direct. Say what to do. Don't say "you might want to consider..."
- Say "you" — talk directly to the student.

### Jargon Policy
- If a technical term is necessary, **explain it immediately** in the same sentence.
- Example: "A hallucination (when AI makes up false information) can be dangerous."
- Never assume the student knows a term.

### Examples
- Every concept MUST have at least one example.
- Show **bad prompt → bad output** first, then **good prompt → good output**.
- Examples must be **realistic** — things a student would actually do.
- Keep example outputs short (3–8 lines max).

## Formatting Rules

### Headings
- Use `##` for main sections (matches SEC codes)
- Use `###` for subsections
- Keep headings short (3–6 words)

### Emojis
- Use sparingly: max 5–7 per lesson
- Allowed in: section headers, key takeaways, tips
- Never in: prompt text, output examples, code blocks
- Preferred emojis: 🎯 ✅ ❌ 💡 🔄 📝 🚀 ⚡ 🧠 📋

### Bullets & Lists
- Use bullets for lists of 3+ items
- Use numbered lists only for ordered steps
- Keep each bullet to 1–2 lines max

### Code/Prompt Blocks
- All prompts go inside code blocks (triple backticks)
- Label prompt blocks with "Prompt:" before them
- Label output blocks with "Output:" before them

### Tables
- Use tables for comparisons (bad vs good, before vs after)
- Keep tables to 3–5 rows max
- Always include a header row

### Spacing
- One blank line between sections
- One blank line before and after code blocks
- No double blank lines

## Vocabulary Rules

### Always Use | Instead Of
| ✅ Use | ❌ Don't Use |
|---|---|
| prompt | query, input, instruction |
| output | response, answer, reply |
| AI / the AI | the model, the LLM, the system |
| framework | methodology, paradigm |
| tweak | modify, alter, adjust |
| hallucination | confabulation, fabrication |
| copy-paste | copy and paste it manually |
| works well | is optimal, is efficacious |

### Banned Phrases
- "It is important to note that..."
- "In order to..."
- "It should be noted..."
- "As we can see..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "At the end of the day..."

### Difficulty Labels
- **Easy** — Anyone can do this with zero experience
- **Medium** — Needs you to think a bit and experiment

## Mobile-Friendly Rules
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible
- Avoid wide tables (max 3 columns)
- Use vertical lists instead of inline lists
- Prompt examples should be readable on a phone screen
